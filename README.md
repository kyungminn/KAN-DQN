# KAN-DQN

## Requirements
We assume you have access to a GPU that can run CUDA 11.8. Then, the simplest way to install all required dependencies is to create an anaconda environment by running

  conda env create -f requirements.yaml

After the installation ends, you can activate your environment with

  conda activate kan
